## ðŸ“œ The MLDir Manifesto
âžœ Each stage in the ML pipeline should be a separate directory.

âžœ If that stage is further broken down into sub-stages, each sub-stage should be a separate directory.

âžœ For any pipeline stage, each alternative that implements that stage should be in a separate directory within that stage's folder.

âžœ Any implementation of a stage is a set of functions.

âžœ Functions are defined only in .py files not in notebooks.

âžœ Notebooks are only for testing or running entire pipelines (e.g., training and hyperparameter tuning). They import the needed functions from pipeline stages.



### ðŸ“œ A more fine-grained version of the MLDir Manifesto also specifies

âžœ In the implementation of any stage, any logic not specifically related to the stage's implementation such as saving or visualizion should be in a seperate function in the file.

âžœ Call the training, validation and testing data x_train, x_val and x_test respectively. x_val is x_val even if x_test doesn't exist (yet). The variable name may be appended with an _{letter} to indicate the stage of the pipeline that resulted in it.

âžœ Once the experimentation phase is over (converged on a pipeline with fixed hyperparameters), the pipeline should be implemented in a single .py file with a single pipeline function. The project, except for this file can be archived at this point (along with a requirements.txt).

### ðŸ“œ Which also has the following extension

âžœ If a pipeline stage takes time then provide a way to save its results and load them later.

âžœ If a pipeline stage may benefit from visualizion then provide a method for that.

âžœ Logging should be implemented for every pipeline.
