## ðŸ“œ The MLDir Manifesto

â–¡ Each stage in the ML pipeline should be a separate directory.

â–¡ For any pipeline stage, each alternative that implements that stage should be in a separate directory within that stage's folder. For instance, different models under the ModelPipelines directory.

â–¡ A model's pipeline is defined as a composition of a processing method, an extracted feature and a model. Different model pipelines reside under the model's folder in the ModelPipelines directory. 

â–¡ If a model's pipeline using processing method P1, features FX and the model is MY then the name of the pipeline notebook file is P1-FX-MY.ipynb. 

â–¡ Any implementation of a stage is a set of functions and it is defined in a .py file within the directory of the specific alternative of the stage. If an implementation is small then one clearly divided Python file grouping various ones may be used.

â–¡ Notebooks are only for demonstration or running entire pipelines (e.g., training and hyperparameter tuning). Functions are never defined in a notebook.

â–¡ Any notebook cell should be preced with a clear heading that describes what it does.

â–¡ Call the training, validation and testing data x_train, x_val and x_test respectively. The variable name may be appended with an _{letter} to indicate the stage of the pipeline that has produced it.

â–¡ Whenever possible, save processed data, features or models if their computation is expensive.

â–¡ Include a Saved directory for saving trained models, figures and other artifacts. S

â–¡ If a pipeline stage may benefit from visualizion then provide a method for that.

â–¡ Similar or related visualizations should be grouped together in the same figure whenever possible.

â–¡ Logging should be implemented for every pipeline.

â–¡ Once the experimentation phase is over (converged on a pipeline with fixed hyperparameters), the pipeline should be implemented in a single .py file with a single pipeline function. The project, except for this file can be archived at this point after producing a requirements.txt
